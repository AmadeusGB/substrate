//! # Council Module
//!
//! The Council module provides tools to manage the council and proposals.
//!
//! - **Seats**
//! 	- [`seats::Trait`](./seats/trait.Trait.html)
//! 	- [`Call`](./seats/enum.Call.html)
//! 	- [`Module`](./seats/struct.Module.html)
//! - **Motions**
//! 	- [`motions::Trait`](./motions/trait.Trait.html)
//! 	- [`Call`](./motions/enum.Call.html)
//! 	- [`Module`](./motions/struct.Module.html)
//! - **Voting**

//! 	- [`Call`](./voting/enum.Call.html)
//! 	- [`Module`](./voting/struct.Module.html)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Council module provides functionality to handle:
//!
//! - The voting in and maintenance of council members.
//! - Proposing, vetoing, and passing motions.
//!
//! The Council's role is to represent passive stakeholders. The Council is an on-chain entity comprised of
//! a set of account IDs. Its primary tasks are to propose sensible referenda and thwart any uncontroversially
//! dangerous or malicious referenda.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! #### Council Proposals (motions.rs)
//!
//! - **Council motion:** A mechanism used to enact a proposal.
//! - **Proposal validity:** A council proposal is valid when it's unique, hasn't yet been vetoed, and
//! when the council term doesn't expire before the block number when the proposal's voting period ends.
//! - **Proposal postponement:** Councillors that abstain from voting may postpone a council proposal from
//! being approved or rejected. Postponement is equivalent to a veto, which only lasts for the cooloff period.
//! - **Cooloff period:** Period, in blocks, for which a veto is in effect.
//!
//! #### Council Proposal Voting (voting.rs)
//!
//! - **Proposal:** A submission by a councillor. An initial vote of yay from that councillor is applied.
//! Unlike the Democracy and Treasury modules, the `Proposal` type is generic and can be anything that
//! can be dispatched (see [`type Proposal`](./motions/trait.Trait.html#associatedtype.Proposal)).
//! - **Referendum:** The means of voting on a proposal.
//! - **Vote:** A vote of yay or nay from a councillor on a single proposal. Councillors may change their vote.
//! - **Veto:** A council member may veto any council proposal that exists. A vetoed proposal that's valid is set
//! aside for a cooloff period. The vetoer cannot re-veto or propose the proposal again until the veto expires.
//! - **Elevation:** A referendum can be _elevated_ from the council to a public referendum. This means it has
//! been passed to the Democracy module for a public vote.
//! - **Referendum cancellation:** At the end of a given block we cancel all elevated referenda whose voting period
//! ends at that block and where the outcome of the vote tally was a unanimous vote to cancel the referendum.
//! - **Voting process to elevate a proposal:** At the end of a given block we tally votes for expiring referenda.
//! Referenda that are passed (yay votes are greater than nay votes plus abstainers) are sent to the Democracy
//! module for a public referendum. If there are no nay votes (abstention is acceptable), then the proposal is
//! for immediate enactment. Otherwise, there will be a delay period. If the vote is unanimous, then the public
//! referendum will require a vote threshold of supermajority against to prevent it. Otherwise,
//! it is a simple majority vote. See [`VoteThreshold`](../srml_democracy/enum.VoteThreshold.html) in the
//! Democracy module for more details on how votes are approved.
//!
//! #### Council Seats (seats.rs)
//!
//! - **Desired seats:** The number of seats on the council. Can change via governance.
//! - **Candidacy bond:** Bond required to be a candidate.
//! - **Leaderboard:** A list of candidates and their respective votes in an election, ordered low to high.
//! - **Presentation:** The act of proposing a candidate for insertion into the leaderboard. Presenting is
//! `O(number of voters)`, so the presenter must be slashable and will be slashed for duplicate or invalid
//! presentations. Presentation is only allowed during the "presentation period," after voting has closed.
//! - **Voting bond:** Bond required to be permitted to vote. Must be held because many voting operations affect
//! storage. The bond is held to disincent abuse.
//! - **Candidate set approval:** Process of inserting votes for oneself into storage. Can be called by anyone as
//! long as he or she is already a voter (and thus has a bond reserved) or has enough reservable currency to
//! place a bond.
//! - **Tally:** When the voting period ends, a snapshot is taken and votes counted. Upon finalization, the
//! new council takes effect.
//! - **Reaping process:** Councillors may propose the removal of other, inactive councillors. If the claim is not
//! valid, the reporter will be slashed. See the [Staking module](../srml_staking/index.html) for more information
//! on slashing.
//!
//! ### Goals
//!
//! The Council module in Substrate is designed to make the following possible:
//!
//! - Create council proposals by councillors using the council motion mechanism.
//! - Validate council proposals.
//! - Tally votes of council proposals by councillors during the proposal's voting period.
//! - Veto (postpone) council proposals for a cooloff period through abstention by councillors.
//! - Elevate council proposals to start a public referendum.
//! - Execute referenda once their vote tally reaches the vote threshold level of approval.
//! - Manage candidacy, including voting, term expiration, and punishment.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! The dispatchable functions in the Council module provide the functionality that councillors need.
//! See the `Call` enums from the motions, seats, and voting modules for details on dispatchable functions.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! The public functions provide the functionality for other modules to interact with the Council module.
//! See the `Module` structs from the motions, seats, and voting modules for details on public functions.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Council Election Procedure
//!
//! A council vote can proceed as follows:
//!
//! 1. Candidates submit themselves for candidacy.
//! 2. Voting occurs.
//! 3. Voting period ends and presentation period begins.
//! 4. Candidates are presented for the leaderboard.
//! 5. Presentation period ends, votes are tallied, and new council takes effect.
//! 6. Candidate list is cleared and vote index increased.
//!
//! ### Motion Elevation Procedure
//!
//! A normal motion elevation would proceed as follows:
//!
//! 1. A councillor makes a proposal.
//! 2. Other councillors vote yay or nay or abstain.
//! 3. At the end of the voting period the votes are tallied.
//! 4. If it has passed, then it will be sent to the Democracy module with the vote threshold parameter.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! This code snippet includes an `approve_all` public function that could be called to approve
//! the eligibility of all candidates when there are empty council seats and when the tally for
//! the next election occurs at the current or a future block number.
//!
//! ```
//! use srml_support::{decl_module, dispatch::Result};
//! use system::ensure_signed;
//! use srml_council::seats;
//!
//! pub trait Trait: seats::Trait {}
//!
//! decl_module! {
//! 	pub struct Module<T: Trait> for enum Call where origin: T::Origin {
//!
//! 		pub fn approve_all(origin) -> Result {
//! 			let _origin = ensure_signed(origin)?;
//!
//! 			// Get the current block number
//! 			let current_block_number = <system::Module<T>>::block_number();
//!
//! 			// Get the number of seats that we want the council to have
//! 			let desired = <seats::Module<T>>::desired_seats() as usize;
//!
//! 			// Get the number of seats occupied by the current council.
//! 			let occupied = <seats::Module<T>>::active_council().len();
//!
//! 			// Get the appropriate block number to schedule the next tally.
//! 			let maybe_next_tally = <seats::Module<T>>::next_tally();
//!
//! 			assert!(desired > occupied, "Unable to approve all candidates when there are no empty seats");
//!
//! 			if let Some(next_tally_block_number) = <seats::Module<T>>::next_tally() {
//! 				if current_block_number <= next_tally_block_number {
//! 					assert!(maybe_next_tally.is_some(),
//! 						"Unable to approve all candidates when the block number of the next tally has past");
//! 				}
//! 			}
//!
//! 			Ok(())
//! 		}
//! 	}
//! }
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Genesis config
//!
//! The Council module depends on the `GenesisConfig`.
//!
//! - [Seats](./seats/struct.GenesisConfig.html)
//! - [Voting](./voting/struct.GenesisConfig.html)
//!
//! ## Related Modules
